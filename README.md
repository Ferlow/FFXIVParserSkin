To use the skin, no download is needed. Simply use the url below as your parsers URL in the OverlayPlugin settings, and you're good to go. This also means the skin will automatically be updated with any changes made!

### The hard way

If you really want to, you can download a copy of the layout completely or clone this repo and then use it locally. This is not recommended, as you would miss out on important updates.

## Features
* Multiple Skins
* Tabs for different configurations (DPS, Healing, Tanking)
* Auto resizing of bars for larger parses
* Configurable layout
* Auto-hiding parser for when you're not fighting
* Role and job colours available for bars
* Override player names with job names
* Post parse to Discord with customisable outputs and auto-posting
* Fully integrated configuration allows you to set up the overlay without editing anything externally
